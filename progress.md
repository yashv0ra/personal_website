Original prompt: Yes, that'd be great. Please create a simple block-style game in the small 3d vertical slice

## 2026-02-09
- Initialized a new 3D block-game vertical slice task.
- Plan: create `/game` route, implement a Three.js block game with start/win/lose loop, and validate with the Playwright client script.
- Implemented a first playable version:
- Added `/game` route and linked it from home.
- Added `components/game/BlockGame3D.tsx` with:
- Start screen and restart loop.
- WASD/arrow movement, jump, pause, fullscreen toggle, and deterministic `window.advanceTime(ms)`.
- `window.render_game_to_text` for state introspection.
- Win condition (touch summit goal cube) and lose condition (enemy collision or fall).
- Added `three` dependency.
- Moved game entry into Lab section:
- Added `/lab` page rendering the 3D game.
- Updated SpiderWeb Lab node from disabled state to an active link.
- Updated home CTA to "Enter the Lab".
- Updated start overlay button text to "Play".
- Removed standalone `/game` route so Lab is the canonical game entry.
- Validation completed:
- Ran Playwright client against `/lab` with `--click-selector "#start-btn"` and action bursts.
- Captured and reviewed screenshots under `output/web-game/lab-smoke`.
- Captured start-screen screenshot under `output/web-game/lab-start` and confirmed Play button is visible.
- Confirmed `window.render_game_to_text` outputs `mode: "start"` before play and `mode: "playing"` during active loop.
- Ran `npm run lint` successfully.
- Removed temporary Playwright screenshots/browser cache artifacts from workspace after validation.
- Camera visibility fix in progress:
- Replaced far isometric camera with a third-person follow camera that trails behind player facing direction.
- Added camera look-ahead smoothing so the player remains centered and clearly visible while moving/jumping.
- Added player-facing state to `render_game_to_text` for easier automated camera verification.
- Camera fix validated:
- Ran Playwright movement/jump loops in webpack dev mode and confirmed the player remains visible in third-person perspective.
- Verified no new console errors on rerun (`output/web-game/camera-fix-rerun` had no `errors-*.json`).
- Ran `npm run lint` after camera changes.
- Tank control update in progress:
- Switched controls to A/D turning and W/S forward/back movement.
- Lowered turn sensitivity and added slightly slower reverse speed for control.
- Updated start-screen control text to match the new key behavior.
- Tank controls validated:
- Ran Playwright control loops with turn + forward/back + jump actions and reviewed screenshots (`output/web-game/tank-controls-arrows`).
- Verified heading changes over time in `render_game_to_text` while forward/back motion follows current facing.
- No new `errors-*.json` generated in the final control validation run.
- Ran `npm run lint` after the control update.
- Third-person camera refinement:
- Tightened camera into an over-the-shoulder third-person view (closer distance, lower height, slight shoulder offset, wider FOV).
- Increased look-ahead to keep forward path readable while preserving player visibility.
- Validated with Playwright gameplay loop and screenshot review (`output/web-game/third-person`), with no new error artifact files.
- Ran `npm run lint` after camera refinement.

### TODOs / Suggestions
- Expand the Lab with a game chooser page if additional prototypes are added later.
- Add a small score progression mechanic during movement to make faster runs more rewarding.
